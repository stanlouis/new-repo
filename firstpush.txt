Pushing code to GitHub is an essential part of modern software development. It involves uploading your local repository changes to a remote repository hosted on GitHub. This process allows you to share your code with others, collaborate on projects, and maintain version control. To push code to GitHub, you typically use Git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. First, you stage your changes using `git add`, then commit them with a descriptive message using `git commit`, and finally, push the changes to the remote repository with `git push`. This workflow ensures that your code is safely backed up and accessible to your team or the public.
